# A Quick End-of-2016 Journey through Open Geospatial Data of Canada and its places.
_A Future article. I intend to publish this on a few sites and places including Medium, Go Geomatics and Canadian GIS._

This will become an article that I'm laying down for the end of the year. It's a list of Canadian data sources. I also intend on updating the Canadian Open Data Wiki with these links.



Recently, I read a long article (http://www.gogeomatics.ca/magazine/easy-access-to-data-the-cgdi-initiative.htm) about the Canadian Geospatial Data Infrastructure (CGDI) that seeks to be, among many things, relevant. While they recently updated the site to reflect changes to the Government of Canada's own Open Data infratructure, they only offer a small glimpse of what's on offer for Open Data in Canada. This is a shame, because there's very few resources that talk about the various open data offerings that cover Canada, whether held in Canada or outside.

##First, a disclaimer.

Everything online is just a snapshot of the present. As methods and the data itself evolves, you will find that some of these links will no longer work. As that happens, you should do something, which I'll propose at the end.

## Aggregators!
There's a lot of sources to talk about. But the first aggregate worth talking about is the [Open Government Programs in Canada Map](http://open.canada.ca/en/maps/open-data-canada), which is a solid example of the limit of aggregation sites: They're usually incomplete as more data sources become available. With this site, the map which shows the locations of all the initiatives only zooms to a certain extent, which is not enough in regions such as Vancouver.

 Affixed to this site that has become somewhat harder to find, it shows the various Open Data programs across Canada and the initiatives, provinces and municipalities that house it. It's a bit incomplete, but it's a nice point to start in the general open data community. As of writing, it appears current.

#### Regions/Towns/Cities/Etc
Unlike other large cities, Victoria and Vancouver aren't amalgamated. This means that the data which is covered in the city's open data portal doesn't cover the entire metropolitan area.

### Alberta
This is where I'll explain Alberta's odd lay of the land. It seems pretty corporate and disjointed, but it's really a focused project that provides the data to those who need it most in industry. 

* [AltaLIS](http://altalis.com/)
* [Open Data Areas](http://opendataareas.ca)
* [Open Data Alberta](https://open.alberta.ca/opendata) This doesn't offer geospatial data, but can be used to generate maps from existing region polygons.

### Ontario
Ontario has a well-developed open data catalogue and a strong community that promotes the use and critique of open data. The province holds most of its open geodata on their [Open Data Catalogue](https://www.ontario.ca/search/data-catalogue?sort=asc). In addition, many of the cities contain their own catalogues:

This past April, the Premier of New Brunswick [News Release](http://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/news/news_release.2016.04.0334.html). You can see their young [data catalogue](http://www.snb.ca/geonb1/e/DC/catalogue-E.asp) is at its starting stages. With luck it will flourish as time goes by.

## All of Canada, from outside Canada or by the best of Canada
There are some _stellar_ sources of data which exists outside of Canada with a global reach. I enjoy using this data and so can you!

  1. First, there's NASA's Earth Explorer [USGS Earth Explorer](earthexplorer.usgs.gov). Unlike the Canadian open data offerings, there are series of individual scenes from the entire Landsat catalogue, digital elevation by map selection as opposed to NTS Tile, and some older orthophotography if you live close to the US Border. It requires an account, but is entirely worth it.
  2. [Geofabrik](Geofabrik.de). This is a site that allows you to download data from OpenStreetMap, the map which you can (and should!) edit.
  3. [Remote Pixel](https://remotepixel.ca/projects/satellitesearch.html) by Vincent Sarago [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_VincentS_)



(More stuff goes here)

## A final call to action.

There is a Wikipedia page that sits unloved, and out of date. If you enjoy using open geodata, and if you love sharing your knowledge about these sources to the world, consider adding a link of your favorite open data portal to this page: [Wikipedia Article on Canadian Open Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data_in_Canada). It doesn't have to be geospatial.
