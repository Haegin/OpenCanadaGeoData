# A Quick End-of-2016 Journey through Open Geospatial Data of Canada and its places. 

Recently, I read a long article (http://www.gogeomatics.ca/magazine/easy-access-to-data-the-cgdi-initiative.htm) about the Canadian Geospatial Data Infrastructure (CGDI) that seeks to be, among many things, relevant. While they recently updated the site to reflect changes to the Government of Canada's own Open Data infratructure, they only offer a small glimpse of what's on offer for Open Data in Canada. This is a shame, because there's very few resources that talk about the various open data offerings that cover Canada, whether held in Canada or outside. 

##First, a disclaimer. 

Everything online is just a snapshot of the present. As methods and the data itself evolves, you will find that some of these links will no longer work. As that happens, you should do something, which I'll propose at the end. 

## Aggregators! 
There's a lot of sources to talk about. But the first aggregate worth talking about is the [Open Government Programs in Canada Map](http://open.canada.ca/en/maps/open-data-canada) Affixed to this site that has become somewhat harder to find, it shows the various Open Data programs across Canada and the initiatives, provinces and municipalities that house it. It's a bit incomplete, but it's a nice point to start in the general open data community. As of writing, it appears current. 

There's some other sources to be had as well.

## A final call to action.

There is a Wikipedia page that sits unloved, and out of date. If you enjoy using open geodata, and if you love sharing your knowledge about these sources to the world, consider adding a link of your favorite open data portal to this page: [Wikipedia Article on Canadian Open Dagta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data_in_Canada). It doesn't have to be geospatial.
